# Combination responses
# This file is used in combination with the \c modifier used in greetings
# or responses.  It combines a random word from each of the columns specified
# to create a unique phrase that can be used in a greeting, or in a response.
#
# The syntax used is \c<name of combo>
# for example, a greeting could be: "Welcome to the channel, you \cinsult!"
# Or a response which insults the bot could return with
#  "Bugger off, you \cinsult!"
#
# Of course you can make combinations of any type, like a Dr. Sbaitso kind
# of psychiatric thing.  There will be more work in this area, and once
# a suitable AI is built these combos may be incorporated into a more
# general scheme later...
