Changes to Grufti
-----------------

grufti-1.0.17  [02mar2000]
* Fixed a crashing bug that occurred when a URL stored in the webcatch
  contained a "%" character.
* Fixed a bug that would cause users not to be unbanned if the user
  doing the banning was not registered on the bot. (found by komakino)


grufti-1.0.16  [02jan2000]
* All dates are now shown with 10 characters instead of 8 so that the full
  year is displayed.  Fixed the 01/01/100 problem.  This required several
  changes as much of the code assumed the date was 8 characters.  Affected
  commands:
     - finger (creation time)
     - whois
     - seen userhost
     - notes
     - showresponse, searchresponse
     - stat
     - banlist
     - showbans
     - showhistory


grufti-1.0.15  [22dec1999]
* Left an unsigned long defined as ulong instead of u_long.


grufti-1.0.14  [21dec1999]
* Web interface was displaying blank pages on some web servers.  Reverted to
  old behavior as this problem hasn't been fully investigated.
* Logs weren't being carried over properly.
* Make Owner and Master exempt from users that get auto deleted.
* Fixed list manager object, which would crash if attempting to sort
  an empty list (fixed by MSK)
* Added ability to merge userlists.  Specify "mergeusers <filename>" in the
  config file, where <filename> is a userlist which is to be merged with the
  current userlist. (written by MSK)


grufti-1.0.13  [29jun99]
* Added last login field.  Gets displayed in finger output, stat listing,
  and nightly reports.
* Fixed gb.cgi again
* Fixed 'meminfo' output so that 4 digit numbers don't get comma'd (and
  therefore don't cause the line to wrap)
* Split cmd.c into cmd1.c and cmd2.c.  Some compilers can't handle large
  source files.


grufti-1.0.12  [23jun99]
* Fixed code that displayed junk in notifications when deleting responses
  from the web page
* Changed my email address everywhere
* Log files are now timestamped, which allows GruftiStats to know the right
  date for the logs (added by cph)
* Made some slight changes to cgi.  If you were having problems with the
  web page interface taking you to a blank page or error page after login,
  try again with this build.
* Allow web page banner image width and height to be set in webconfig.h.
* Fixed code that was causing the bot to crash on Xnet, as a result of
  bad USERHOST replies (fixed by cph)
* Improved code to deal with dynamic hostnames (added by cph)
* Fixed 'setvar' command so that quoted arguments can be set, and so that
  erroneous message "unable to set variable" is quenched.
* Fixed security hole that allowed users to send commands on behalf of other
  users.  If JoeHax0r changes to a nick of Mary's and sends a command that
  requires a password, that command would get executed by Mary next time
  she logged in and sent her password.  We now use a timeout configurable
  in config.gb (pending-command-timeout), and require the nicks to be the
* New command: delhostmask


grufti-1.0.11  [12mar99]
* Updated configure to reflect minor version.
* Moved welcome text from dcc.c to etc/welcome.  This text is sent to
  new users over DCC CHAT.  See entry welcome-dcc in config.gb.
* Modified some help text in etc/help.
* Added 'searchresponse' to topics cool and response
* New command: searchresponse
* Fixed bug with 'setother' commands that allowed users to set their
  info field to a length that was larger than permitted.
* Modified 'pass' command so that it takes an optional user@hostmask as an
  argument.  This allows users to validate accounts that are listed in
  their whois.
* Added config setting that controls whether users can send their password
  via normal message.  The default is to require DCC.  See the config
  setting 'require-dcc-for-pass-command'.
* Modified 'pass' command so that it requires users to use a correct
  password if they're already authenticated.  The old behavior was to
  tell the user they already sent their password regardless of the whether
  the password was actually correct.
* Fixed bug that displayed 0 hour usage as 0.1 for H/Day.
* When reading Notes, extra information about the Note is displayed in
  the "---------" area.
* New command: showother
* New command: delother
* Modified usage message for 'showresponse' command.
* Setup hooks for response history.  Not implemented yet.
* Fixed bug in 'addhistory' command.  No arguments would not show usage
  message.
* New command: setusernumber
* New command: setusercreation
* The 'setusernumber' and 'setusercreation' commands should only be used
  when accounts are accidentally deleted, and the original info is
  desired.  No checking is done to assert that user numbers don't collide.
* Mirrored 'setlocation' as 'setlocat'.  Some users see 'locat' in the
  finger display and try 'setlocat' to set it.
* Fixed stat counter 'commands'.
* Fixed bug where signoff messages were being assigned to non-registered
  user entry.  This was causing the bot to display erroneous signoff
  messages for non-registered users.
* Modified copyright string so that it contained major and minor build
  information.
* Fixed bug in Setup web page that caused the user not to be able to
  enter text in the web page field.
* Fixed 'setbday' command so that users couldn't enter crazy years.
* Fixed topic not showing up on web page.


grufti-1.0.10  [15oct98]
* Removed "DCC connection limit reached" message.  This was causing the
  bot to flood off when lusers tried flooding the bot with DCC requests.
* Updated all instances of variable argument functions so that they were
  called with proper syntax.  This should fix the "%" problems.
* New channel flag to keep the key from being shown from channel listing.
  (suggested by zinn)
* Changed 'banlist' output, now includes numbered entries that can be used
  to identify the ban when deleting.  (suggested by Illusion)
* Fixed it so that when long lines with no spaces are split, the last 
  character doesn't get eaten.
* New command: wallnote <level> <msg...>
  Allows you to send mass notes to users matching levels (ie. +3o-f)
* Fixed bug that caused history lines to get formatted incorrectly when
  multiple mode changes occurred from one command. (fixed by Uhlume)
* Fixed bug that resulted in carriage returns being displayed from the
  watchlog command.
* Added check for shitlisted user (banlist) when a nick change is detected.
* Changed 'configinfo' output so that long variable names could be displayed.
* Added 'Command-Line' area to Web page.  Finally...
* Fixed bug that wouldn't allow people to compile the cgi on machines where
  <sys/types.h> didn't include abbreviated types.  (fixed by Mattison)
* Fixed bug in cgi that results in blank pages being displayed when the
  web server doesn't set REMOTE_HOST.  (found by Mattison)
* Updated the help file so that instances of "Grufti" were replaced with
  "\n".  Didn't we already do this?
* Still having some problems with the bot failing to acknowlege on DCC CHAT...


grufti-1.0.09  [15aug98]
* Fixed network interface, where an EOF in one case could pass undetected.
* Fixed byte ordering problem which caused the bot not to connect on DCC CHAT.
* Updated Makefile so that compiler optimization is set to O2 for IRIX users.
* Fixed account history display and new owner being added.


grufti-1.0.08  [14aug98]
* New net.c core, new command module, new listmgr module.  Gearing up
  for Grufti2.0.
* Support for +l and +L.  See config.gb under response for details.
* Public support for 'info' command.  Usage is: <botnick> info <nick> <slot>
  For example:  "grufti info arkham music"  will have the bot display the
  music slot for Arkham, if one is set (under 'other').  Slots 'email', 'www'
  and 'bday' work too.  Saying "grufti email arkham" will soon become just
  an alias for "grufti info arkham email".  This command isn't quite done
  yet.  Will embellish on later.
* Changed the 'seen' command to require a DCC connection.  It was possible
  to flood the bot off when doing /msg grufti seen *@*.
* Fixed a bug that caused the bot to crash too many dcc chat requests were open.
* Fixed a bug that wouldn't allow users to CHAT the bot when allow-dcc-send
  was set to false.
* Fixed a bug that wouldn't allow config variable strings with commands to
  be parsed correctly.
* Unknown config file entries cause a fatal error on startup instead of
  being logged and ignored.
* Added config entries 'auto-detect-takeover' and 'takeover-in-progress-msg'.
* Changed the install script so that it reads the version number from the
  config file, and updates it appropriately.
* NOTE: the command 'reset-motd' has been temporarily changed to 'resetmotd'
        due to the new command restructuring.
* Account history support.  Logs when user has a level change, or when a master
  adds a log event manually.  Use 'showhistory' and 'addhistory'.


grufti-1.0.07  [21apr98]
* Made some text more readable in config.gb.
* Support for +l and +L almost ready, preparation changes in cmd.c and
  config.gb.
* Fixed bug introduced in last release which doesn't allow users with +l
  to add responses from the web page.  (web page was wanting USER_RESPONSE
  which was mapped to +L, oops!)
* Fixed bug in 'users' command.  Flag arguments which matched no users would
  display redundant message. (found by Dethtonge)
* Replaced BUFSIZ allocation for strings with more appropriate sizes.
* Preparations for TinyGrufti code, new files tgrufti.c, tgrufti.h, tgcmd.c,
  tgcmd.h.  This will not be fully working until version 1.1, the next major
  release.
* Found a really nasty bug involving memory being corrupted.  This is causing
  the flags for a DCC record to change for no reason.  This is critical since
  there are about 30 different flags which control the state of any DCC
  device, and when the flags change for no reason we get real problems.
  (NOT RESOLVED YET)
* Added make install-cgi option to the Makefile.in in the src directory.
* Added README file to webstuff directory.
* Added register.html to webstuff directory.


grufti-1.0.06  [10apr98]
* Bug in suffixes for birthdays.  21st, 22nd, 23rd were showing up as
  "21th, 22th, 23th"  (found by DethTonge)
* Added Event Calendar to the web page area.  Users can sign up for
  events, remove themselves, and always have access to changing their
  event info from the page.
* Modified Event display (showevents) to display blanks instead of N/A.
* NEED_WRITE flag wasn't being set when users removed themselves from events.
* Removed the hardwired "Grufti" in Grufti Notices so that they now read
  BOT Notices, where BOT is the name of the bot.
* URL Catch (webcatch) added to the web page area.  (by uhlume)
* Stat area added to the web page.  (by uhlume)
* The following changes were also made by Uhlume which greatly improve the look
  and flexibility of the web page area, and which fix a number of bugs.
    - control characters now perform expected results on web page
      (ie: ^b is bright text)
    - html tags properly escaped and translated (&lt, &quot, etc)
    - Fixed bug in users listing, wasn't showing last user in table
    - Fixed bug in setup, max limit on greetlines not working
    - Replaced occurrences of 'Grufti' with Grufti->botnick.
    - Cleaned up Response code so that the response types weren't
      hardwired into the page
    - Tightened up Toolbar to include more entries, channel name
      no longer hardwired to the toolbar.
    - General cleanup of font sizes, headings, etc.  More consistent.
* Designated a webconfig.h to control all web_module settings.  Any bot owners
  with CGI support should be able to get their web interface up and running.
  Summary of steps in webconfig.h added to assist bot owners in CGI setup.
* Added nick search box to user listing and each finger display
* Fixed adding Locations routine in Setup so that cities with multiple words
  parse correctly.
* Added config file entry to give us the option of making the bot exit if
  we couldn't get the requested telnet or gateway port.  This is important
  since we don't want our bot listening on a different port if it couldn't get
  the one that was specified, and having us wonder why the web page and
  gateway clients are not working. (set quit-port-request-failed 1)
* Added the ability to type 'make cgi' from the botdir.
* WEB_MODULE now defined by default.  Edit the Makefile and undefine it
  if you know you won't be needing it.
* Idlekick routines not working right.  Hopefull fixed. (found by WeaselBoy)
* We check to make sure u_char, u_int, etc are defined and if not, define
  them.  This leads to erratic bugs every so often.
* Added 'install-cgi' script to help in the installation of the CGI.
* Modified README to make installation a little clearer.
* Last seen time for account and user were not being set when they dropped
  off IRC and they weren't on a channel.


grufti-1.0.05  [31mar98]
* MOTD only shows when motd has changed.  New command 'reset-motd' needs to
  be used whenever the motd is changed on disk.  If command is not run, users
  will never see the new motd unles they specifically request it.  Config
  variable 'show-motd-onlywhenchanged' added to give control of this feature.
* New config variable 'auto-detect-takeover'.  This will set a flag whenever
  the bot can't join a channel due to invite-only, or banned from channel.
  When the flag is set, the bot will message registered users who join IRC
  and inform them of the takever, stored in 'takeover-in-progress-msg'.
  can be overridden by turning OFF auto-detect-takever, and setting the
  'takeover-in-progress' flag yourself via setvar.
* Fixed 'delserver' bug that crashed the bot whenever it was used.
* Added config variable 'allow-dcc-send' which specifies whether or not the
  bot will accept DCC SEND requests.  (reports of the bot crashing on mass
  dcc send requests)
* Modified the routine under 'pass' so that users with +o are given ops
  even if they have already sent their password.  (before it would just return)
* Cleaned up 'pass' command
* Cleaned up 'delresponse' command, name of response now shown when lines are
  deleted.
* Fixed bug in 'whoami' command which is supposed to show finger info for
  current user, but was just showing default 'finger' with no arguments.
* DCC, telnet logins now log to LOG_RAW also.
* Added support for kicking idle users.  Control is done through the config
  variables 'kick-channel-idlers', 'idle-time', 'idlekick-timeout', and
  'kick-idle-opers'.  They can be found in the channel config section.  The
  default behaviour is not to kick idlers.

grufti-1.0.04  [16jan98]
* Added an EVENT LIST which stores upcoming events and who will be attending.
   - Commands: addevent, delevent, showevents, showevent, seteventname,
               seteventplace, seteventdates, seteventabout, seteventadmin,
               attendevent, unattendevent, seteventwhen, seteventcontact,
               eventnote
   - Config file: send-notice-event-created, send-notice-event-deleted
                  eventsfile, write-backup-events,
   - new files: event.c, event.h
   - help subjects: (not including commands) event, events
* Removed 'Loading commands' and 'Loading webcmds' from startup screen
* Update install script to handle direct installs (only writes executable
  to new location).  Use 'make xinstall', but with caution...
* Updated install script to exit if running bot is detected in install dir.
* Fixed spelling errors in command help outputs
* Updated 'chlocation' and 'dellocation' to recognize when invalid numbers
  aren't just improper strings.
* 'write' command wasn't showing correct lists you could use if you typed
  one that wasn't supported.
* Fixed install script to run under AIX sh.
* More clear that +w is the owner account when first creating owner account
* If no process is found for pid in pid file, pid file is removed.
* Added birthday field to 'finger' info.  The 'showbdays' command is used
  to display all months with birthdays, or whose birthdays are occurring
  for a given month.
   - Commands: setbday, showbdays
* Added 'set bday' field to 'setup' page in Grufti land.  (src-cgi/webclient.c
  modified to support bday field)
* Added 'showbdays' hook on channel to display who's birthdays are occuring
  in the next 2 weeks.
* Added 'bday' hook (and 'birthday') on channel to display a nick's birthday.
* Removed some topics from 'subject cool' in the help file.  Added 'showbdays'
* Adjusted 'got' routines so we don't have to wait for the WHO channel list
  to finish before we can start responding to public chatter and joins.
* Updated 'checkforurl/email/bday' routines so we can ask real questions
  such as "what is xxx's birthday?"
* Added virtual hosting.  Config entry is 'virtual-hostname'.  Set ONLY if you
  are using a hostname which is registered to the domain from which the bot 
  is running.


grufti-1.0.03  [3jan98]
* Added alias 'mail' which points to 'email' command
* Added 'forward' help subject to describe 'setforward' and 'forwardnotes'
* Added 'setinfo' help subject which mirrors 'account' help subject
* Grufti Land setup was inserting 'http:\\' instead of 'http://' as default
  web address. (found by SANdMAN)
* Leaving 'http://' in the Grufti Land www box would end up setting the user's
  url to 'http://' instead of setting it to none. (fixed)
* Added routine to display signoff messages for users, displayed from a
  'have you seen' request or 'seen' command.  The bot had been trapping signoff
  messages for months, but I just never got around to sticking them in the
  have you seen responses.  Signoff messages are stored in database too.
* Kicks were not being incremented correctly.  It turns out a user's kick
  status was only increased if the kickee was REGISTERED.  Doh! (fixed)
* Added capability to display signoff messages from 'have you seen' command
  for signoffs other than IRC (ie. via web page, or via telnet)
* TODO: Need to find a way of resetting signoff message when all nicks have
  signed off, NOT via QUIT on channel.  Right now, if a user telnets in to 
  the bot for example, and then parts the channel and signs off, we'll still
  have the signoff message from the telnet session...
* Updated 'finger' command to display correct last seen if user has no
  hostmasks.  (Hasn't been seen in over x days where 'x' is hostmask timeout) 
* Check for gotpossiblesignon() in gotjoin(). (This wasn't in here before
  so that the bot wouldn't inform the user of notes immediately on join,
  possibly causing the user to miss the message.  As soon as USERHOST cycled
  around again (~5 or so mins) the user would be notified... but i don't like
  that any more.)
* Bot no longer informs user he can't op them on certain channels if the user
  isn't even on the channel.  (ie. Doing 'op' with no arguments)


grufti-1.0.02  [9dec97]
* Stat was showing timeout for Notes as timeout_users, not timeout_notes.
* Fatal error for "config file not found" was trying to display name of
  file as argument, which isn't supported in fatal().
* Added commands 'email' and 'url'.
* Added detailed breakdown of stats to 'stat <nick>' command.
* Fixed some spelling errors in help file
* Added config-file entry for "10:15 on a saturday night".  Default is OFF.
  UTC's are still hardcoded so you'll have to change them if you're not on PST.
* Help 'levels' wasn't showing level w (owner level)
* install script wasn't parsing ~ correctly (new install script by rubella)
* Tweaked code in certain places to make sure Usage time truly reflected
  actual time seen.  Since the bot waits until a user leaves IRC before he
  can add that amount of time to their total usage, we need to make sure we
  account for that if the person is online right now.  This was being
  overlooked in a few places resulting in 'stat' usage being a little off
  from 'finger' usage etc.
* Bugfix: in calculating usage in 'finger', 3600 * 7 is NOT 25620.  :>
* updated checkforstat() to recognize 'stats' as well as 'stat' on channel
* Added commands 'setforward' and 'forwardnotes'.  Now you can have your
  Notes automatically forwarded to an email address, or forward all the Notes
  in your mailbox.  Notes received by users with forwarding addresses are
  marked 'FORWARD' and are sent every 'dequeuenotes-freq' seconds.  The bot
  also uses an SMTP gateway which you can specify with 'smtp-gateway'.  No
  checking is done on the validity of an email address.  Notes forwarded to
  invalid addresses will DISAPPEAR!  (well, they might be returned to the
  sender if your bot username and host are valid)
* Added config file entries: 'smtp-gateway', 'dequeuenotes-freq', 'smtp-timeout'
* Modified informuserofnotes() so that users with forwarding addresses don't
  get bugged with new, incoming Notes.
* Finger info displays 'Fwd' instead of # Notes if user is forwarding
* Modified 'setemail' to use only the first argument as the email address
  (forwardnotes() uses this as your return address in email)
* Added 'x Notes forwarded' to status reports
* Timeout routines for Users, Accounts, and Notes were a day short. (fixed)
* Dropped 'Serv codes' display from start screen


grufti-1.0.01  [11Nov97]
* still working on '%' bug.  Moved killpercentchars() routine so that
  % characters are killed before any of the response checks (url, email, etc)
* Bugfix: 'stat bans' wasn't displaying the header (found by Nicholas)
* Bugfix: 'have you seen my' was going voodoo if nothing was specified after
  the 'my' (fixed)
* Bot still wasn't keeping track of all of its own public chatter (fixed)
* Added '10:15 on a Saturday night' :> (request by nada)
* Increased buffer for 'have you seen my' (request by rubella)
* Added 'showbans' command to display channel bans (different from 'banlist')
* Bugfix: NULL pointer assignment in 'uhush' command (fixed)
* Added aliases 'showdcc', 'showmem', 'showconfig', 'showconfigs', 'showcodes',
  'servers', 'showservers', 'showcommands'.
* got367() (channel bans) wasn't parsing nick and uh for person who set ban.
* Bugfix: chatter, kicks, and bans weren't being reset for each day. (found by
  rayne)
* Bugfix: userlist wasn't storing stats for web/telnet commands (fixed)
* Users weren't being informed of incoming Notes if the Note came from the
  web page.
* Added AWAY field in channel member records... for now we don't do anything
  with this information, but maybe we'll use it to add up usage times for when
  users aren't away etc.
* Added an 'install' script that can be invoked with 'make install'.  This
  greatly simplifies upgrading to a new version.  As a result, unpacking the
  bot will contain a different directory structure.
* Modified the README file a bit to reflect new changes, and made it more
  organized and pleasing to the eye.
* Added FORCE switch to 'writeallfiles()' which gives us the option to write
  empty files to disk.  This gets rid of the problem of bot files not being
  found on startup and during backups.
* Added the helpfile translator \w which translates into the bot's homepage
* Switched version scheme to use incremental number instead of date.
  Bugfixes and normal distributions will increment in the last digits.
  Significant releases will have versions which increment in the middle digits.
  The next significant release is not expected to happen until after 1998,
  when AI is possibly introduced.  Releases which change the version number
  in the first digit will probably never happen, unless the bot is basically
  rewritten from scratch, or the middle digits are at .9.


v1.0_1104  [04nov97]
* Bugfix: 'have you seen %a%b%c...' was making the bot crash.  Fixed for now,
  but this % problem is evident in any routine which makes use of any of the
  'say' routines.  Well need to fix this once and for all sometime. (found by
  nada)
* Bugfix: DCC file transfers which occur in less than 1 second were making
  the bot crash, due to a divide-by-0 overlook. (fixed)
* Bot wasn't logging topic changes (fixed)
* Made alias 'kb' to point to kickban command.
* Bot wasn't keeping track of its own public chatter (fixed)
* Added 'help' to skel directory


v1.0_1026  [26oct97]
* Bugfix: 'stat' report wasn't showing most up-to-date time for servers

* Bugfix: log files weren't being moved to .yesterday (fixed)
* Bugfix: rn <nick> was working like 'showmylastnote <nick>' (fixed)
* Bugfix: Entering usernames longer than 8 characters was not letting users
