GruftiStats
===========

$Id: README,v 1.1 1999/06/06 11:52:49 cphipps Exp $

GruftiStats is a program to read logs from a Grufti bot (an IRC bot by Steve Rider, see ftp://area23.org/pub/Grufti/). It produces a web page, with various statistics and quotes from the channel; the idea was got from the cool MircStats program.

See http://www.daaave.org/~cph/grufti/ for the latest information about GruftiSrats, latest source download, and a link to some sample output.

GruftiStats is written by Andy Kempling (aurikan@hotmail.com) and Colin Phipps (cph@lxdoom.linuxgames.com). GruftiStats is free software, see the file COPYING for information.

Setup
-----

GruftiStats requires that all logs have the Grufti time stamp, and this requires a small patch to the grufti bot.

Add this bit of code to main.c, and recompile. This just adds a time stamp to all log files. GruftiStats will work without this, but it will show lots of activity as "Unknown" date.

Also, you need to make sure you are producing the right logs that GruftiStats will use. In the Grufti config.gb file, you want a line like:

logfile	"channel.log" p #mychannel

Once you've done the recompile (if you choose to do that), and have made sure you have the right logging enabled, restart your Grufti.

Next, run 'make' in the gruftistats directory. Copy the GruftiStats binary to wherever you'd like to run it from.

To run gruftistats, you run:

gruftistats [-o outfile] [-r respfile] [filelist ...]

where:

filelist ...
is a list of grufti log files; you could just specify ~/grufti/logs/channel.log. Personally I have a system set up which sorts my logs for each day and then uasses a list of the last 7 days logs to GruftiStats.

respfile
is a config file. Blank lines or those starting with a # are comments. A sample config file is included below. Basically this sets your channel name, and some other cosmetics for the output page like colours.

outfile
is the file to write the html output to (stdout if not given).

Sample config file
------------------

channame=mychannel
myname=Grufti
myemail=cph@lxdoom.linuxgames.com
page_bg=000000
page_text=D0D0D0
page_text_contrast=FFFF40
date_bg=000060
table_index_bg=800000
table_nick_bg=401000
table_2_bg=303030
table_3_bg=101040
table_head_nick=800000
table_head_other=0x303040
statwords=lol,heh
botname=grufti
botname2=bot
botname3=gbot

That's all the options, hopefully they're fairly self-explanatory, colours are in RRGGBB hex format like HTML.

Status
------

Ok it doesn't compile without warnings at the moment, there are a few bugs, once aurikan has finished his latest batch of edits I'll try and fix everything :-).
