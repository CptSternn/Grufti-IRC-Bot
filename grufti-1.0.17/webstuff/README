  Welcome image used when logging in.  Use as an idea for your own pic.

index.html
  The main page that allows users to login.  It contains the html to
  access your gb.cgi.  Note the use of the word 'YOUR'.  This means you
  MUST edit the index.html file to have it point to your own gb.cgi.
  If not, you'll be logging into my grufti, and that's probably not what
  you want.

register.html
  People who try to login and who aren't registered will be shown a
  screen which points to this page.  Its purpose is to let people know
  how they can register with the bot and login.
