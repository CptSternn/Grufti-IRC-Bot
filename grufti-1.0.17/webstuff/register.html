Welcome to Grufti Land! If you are already a member of Grufti, go back and log in using the same username and password you use with the bot on IRC.<p>
If you are not a member, and have no idea what I'm talking about, the process is very simple, provided you have an understanding of IRC.  If IRC and bots have no meaning in your life whatsoever, you probably won't find the Registered area of Grufti very useful anyway.  Go back and play in the Non-Registered area, it's just as cool :><p>
If you've gotten this far and you are still saying "Yes, I know about IRC and channels and bots and I want to register with Grufti, the bot on channel #gothic", then you need simply to do the following:<p>
<pre>
  1) Join IRC using an EFNET server
  2) Determine Grufti is actually in your part of the IRC universe
  3) /dcc chat Grufti
</pre>
He'll give you instructions on what you are to do next.<p>
That's it!  Now you can send and read Notes to and from other IRC folks, set account info, and you have the ability to gain higher levels on the bot.
